# AppLab

See the live version of [AppLab](https://pawlovskiii.github.io/applab-website/).

The project was mainly about learning of usage of responsive web design (RWD). Within mobile-first methodology. Secondly, I tried to improve my  BEM skills around proper naming of the CSS classes. I also use GitHub Pages for the deployment process.

**Main features**:

- RWD
- BEM
- HTML Semantic Elements
